I've decided to develop a gameboy emulator in order to become more engaged in the subject of emulation and eventually move on to contributing to projects
like Yuzu and Ryujinx. 

There's not much now, but there is certainly a backbone for everything to come to fruition. 
I've decided to write it in C in order to learn the language, as well as set myself up to work with C++ on other projects. 

As of Now, I have about half of the instruction set implemented.

I decided to rewrite my code after seeing some other types of implementations and have come to find it much easier to work in this format. 
Even though I've done a majority of the work before, and I am often moving code, it still feels much easier to do what I want to do, and I'm
glad I decided to shift things.

CINOOP's realtime debugger has taught me a lot about the importance of debuggers. It's very interesting to see how necessary it is to write
code that tests your code. I've heard of debugging and tests that are much longer than individual pieces of code, and that developers mainly
spend time testing code rather than running it. That may or may not be true but it's definitely conceivable.

After having finally passed all of Blargg's cpu instruction tests, I realized how beneficial it would've been for me to put effort into finding out how to work them in the beginning and use them to track  my progress. When I finished my cpu implementation without testing and moved on to unsuccessfully implementing the PPU, it made me really discouraged because I felt as though I would never get it to work. Having this structure, something that can empirically track my progress has done wonders for me.

Tetris and Dr. Mario is now completely playable. I need to do sound and fix timing issues along with work out some visual glitches but everything is alright, because at last you can play the game.
