# Gameboy-Emulator


I've decided to develop a gameboy emulator in order to become more engaged in the subject of emulation and eventually move on to contributing to projects
like Yuzu and Ryujinx. 

There's not much now, but there is certainly a backbone for everything to come to fruition. 
I've decided to write it in C in order to learn the language, as well as set myself up to work with C++ on other projects. 

As of Now, I have about half of the instruction set implemented.

I decided to rewrite my code after seeing some other types of implementations and have come to find it much easier to work in this format. 
Even though I've done a majority of the work before, and I am often moving code, it still feels much easier to do what I want to do, and I'm
glad I decided to shift things.

CINOOP's realtime debugger has taught me a lot about the importance of debuggers. It's very interesting to see how necessary it is to write
code that tests your code. I've heard of debugging and tests that are much longer than individual pieces of code, and that developers mainly
spend time testing code rather than running it. That may or may not be true but it's definitely conceivable.
