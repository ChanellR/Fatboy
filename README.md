I've decided to develop a gameboy emulator in order to become more engaged in the subject and eventually move on to contributing to projects
like Yuzu and Ryujinx. 

There's not much now, but there is certainly a backbone for everything to come to fruition. 
I've decided to write it in C in order to learn the language, as well as set myself up to work with C++ on other projects.
