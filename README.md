# Fatboy! üôèüèæ

Fatboy was written for the purposes of learning about low-level programming, the C language and emulation in general for future projects.
It was project that around a month and a half to complete, starting on 11/19/23 and releasing the first official version on 1/3/23.
It Utilizes SDL2 for Visual and Auditory Output. A concurrent release of the SDL2.dll is included.

It was extremely difficult, but I learned about an abundance of topics: Compilation, Interpretation, Display Rendering, Digital Audio Processing,
Assembly Languages, General Software Development Workflow, etc. I'm very glad I decided to pursue this.

## Screenshots

Compatible with all these titles and perhaps more, with minor auditory and visual bugs in pok√©mon Red.

	gcc -I./src -ISDL2/Include -LSDL2/lib -o Fatboy src/*.c -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lcomdlg32 -lgdi32
```
