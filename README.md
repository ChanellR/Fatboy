# Fatboy! üôèüèæ

Fatboy was written for the purposes of learning about low-level programming, the C language and emulation in general for future projects.
It took around a month and a half to complete, starting on 11/19/22 and releasing the first official version on 1/3/23.
It utilizes SDL2 for visual and auditory output. A currently up to date release of the SDL2.dll is included.

It was extremely difficult, but I learned about an abundance of Computer Enginnering topics: Compilation, Interpretation, Display Rendering, Digital Audio Processing,
Assembly Languages, General Software Development Workflow, etc. I'm very glad I decided to pursue this.

## Screenshots

Compatible with all these titles and perhaps more, with minor auditory and visual bugs in pok√©mon Red.

## Installation

You can either download the latest release or build the source code with make.

```
output:
	gcc -I./src -ISDL2/Include -LSDL2/lib -o Fatboy src/*.c -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lcomdlg32 -lgdi32
```
