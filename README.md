# Gameboy-Emulator


I've decided to develop a gameboy emulator in order to become more engaged in the subject of emulation and eventually move on to contributing to projects
like Yuzu and Ryujinx. 

There's not much now, but there is certainly a backbone for everything to come to fruition. 
I've decided to write it in C in order to learn the language, as well as set myself up to work with C++ on other projects. 

As of Now, I have about half of the instruction set implemented.

I decided to rewrite my code after seeing some other types of implementations and have come to find it much easier to work in this format. 
Even though I've done a majority of the work before, and I am often moving code, it still feels much easier to do what I want to do, and I'm
glad I decided to shift things.
